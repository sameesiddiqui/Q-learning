This directory contains files to train, test, and view the results of our Q-learning algorithm.

We've already included trained Q-tables, but if you want to train our AI again, simply run:
<python/python3> learningDriver.py <FrozenLake-v0/Taxi-v2>
using your alias for python3 and the appropriate environment

If you want to test run our AI on the same benchmarks included in the report, run:
python testingDriver.py <environment>

And finally if you want to visualize a single run of either game, run:
python3 forVideo.py <environment> discounted=<True/False>

This will perform a single simulation, so you may need to do multiple runs to see a failure/success.
